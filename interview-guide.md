The Ultimate Software Engineering Internship Interview Guide

Software engineering summer internship applications often follow this process:

Online application
Online technical assessment (via HackerRank, HireVue or another provider)
Live interview(s) covering behavioral and technical questions
It’s often this process that provides candidates with an opportunity to showcase their technical skills and their passion for the company and role for which they applied.

 

Online application:

Tips for your online application have been covered in your exclusive content unlocked after completing task 1. As a reminder:

Many companies open applications for software engineering internships open or near 1 August. Be sure to apply as close to the opening date as possible because applications are reviewed on a rolling basis (that means, the earlier you apply, the better your chances of landing a role).
Some companies will ask you to select a preferred work location or multiple preferred locations in priority order. Selecting emerging tech hubs like Delaware, Florida, Ohio or Texas as your first preference can increase your chances of securing a role as they may be less competitive.
Ensure you meet the eligibility requirements for the role prior to applying. Examples of common eligibility criteria include an expected graduation date between December 2024 and June 2026, meeting a minimum GPA threshold, computer science or related major, authorization to work in the United States without sponsorship. If you don’t meet the eligibility requirements, you may find that your application is auto-rejected by a company’s applicant tracking system.
For insights on JPMorgan’s application process specifically, have a look at their ‘How We Hire’ page.

 

Technical assessment:

After you complete and submit your application, it will go through an automated review to check that you are eligible for the role. If you are eligible, you may receive an invitation to complete an online technical assessment.
You will generally have a deadline to undertake your technical assessment and once you start, you will usually have to complete the assessment in one sitting.
Your application will not be reviewed by a recruiter until you have completed your technical assessment, so it is helpful if you complete it shortly after receiving it.
The most common technical assessment is called HackerRank. To prepare for HackerRank, you should complete problems on LeetCode. You can search on LeetCode for example problems used by various different companies (for example JPMorgan). 
It is common to feel unprepared for a technical assessment even after you have completed multiple practice problems on LeetCode. This is normal, try not to worry about it. Successful candidates advised they aimed to solve a minimum of 1-2 problems per day, and up to 5 problems per day during the 2-4 weeks leading up to applications opening. 
Your aim should be to become:
Competent at completing ‘Easy’ level problems on LeetCode with any edge cases solved
Competent at attempting ‘Medium’ level problems on LeetCode. It is not a major issue if some edge cases remain unsolved
Familiar at completing LeetCode problems under time pressure.

 

Live Interview:

After you submit your technical assessment, your application is sent to a recruiter (usually at your first preference location) for review. Unfortunately there is no specific timeline for your application to be reviewed because it differs based on the company you applied for, the role, the location and the timing of when you applied. So don’t stress if you hear back quickly about some applications and slowly for others. 
If your application moves beyond this stage, you will typically receive an invitation to a live interview. Depending on the company, there may be multiple rounds of live interviews or you may have back to back live interviews on a single day (this is called a ‘Superday’). Some companies will do these interviews in-person and others will conduct the interviews over Zoom.
This interview stage involves a mixture of behavioral questions and technical questions that give you an opportunity to demonstrate coding skills in real time (data structures and algorithms are common topics for the technical component and you may be asked questions about your personal projects).
When asked to code, don’t jump straight into coding. First, explain your approach to the interviewer and then commence coding.
Companies are looking for candidates that demonstrate knowledge of what they do in the tech space and are seeking candidates that show an interest in this. Talking about your participation in their virtual experience program (and specific parts that you enjoyed) is an amazing way to stand out.
Across almost all companies, interviewers for both technical and behavioral sections tend to be very kind and make the environment as welcoming and inviting as possible. No need to stress, just try your best and to enjoy yourself.

 

Offer:

After completing the interview stage, you will be notified whether you have received an offer or not. Again, there is unfortunately no standard timeline, some may find out within a few days, whereas other candidates may find out weeks later
